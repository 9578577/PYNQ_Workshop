# Session 4 designs

This repository contains the compiled bitstreams for the PYNQ workshop session 4 examples and corresponding HWH and Tcl files. The Tcl files can be used to rebuild the hardware design in Vivado.



## PS GPIO

Source the following file from Vivado:

ps_gpio.tcl

You will need to add the pin constraints if you want to rebuild the bitstream.

## AXI GPIO

Source the following file from Vivado:

axi_gpio.tcl

You will need to add the pin constraints if you want to rebuild the bitstream.

## DMA Tutorial

Source the following file from Vivado:

dma_tutorial.tcl

## Resizer

The resizer example sources are part of a larger "PYNQ_HelloWorld" example and can be found here:
